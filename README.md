# push_swap_visualization
A simple visualization techinque for the push_swap algorithm

- If you are working on the push_swap project, this simple app might be very useful to help you visualize the instructions that are used to sort stacks.
You can add extra features by cloning and editing this github repo.

- The design is shit to agree on!

# How it works:

- When you open the app, you are prompted to enter the numbers you want to sort. You have to enter numbers separated by one space, The prompt will always be asking to enter the number when the input you provided doesn't respect the subject rules which include, Entering a non-digit character other than space, entering a value than an integer can't hold, and a duplicated value.

- You will have the numbers on the stack A, the first number that you entered will be at the bottom of the stack and the last one would be on top.
- You will have a button for each instruction for each stack.
